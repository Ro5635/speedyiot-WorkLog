# Work Log

## Introduction 

This system contains the running log of work completed against my final year project. This site is generated from the raw markdown files that make up the weekly logs. This site is automatically updated on each merge into the master branch of the project work log git repository.

In order to navigate this site use the navigation bar on the left and select a week for view, this will expand and show the selection for the days within that week that can be viewed.

> Weeks are full 7 days, this means that where a month transition occurs the trailing days will appearer in the preceding month.
